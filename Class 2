Class 2:
this assigns variables mystring1 and mystring2

mystring1='hello'
mystring2="hello"

the operator [] will give you the letters in position 1:5
print(mystring2[1:5])

this will give the length of the string mystring2
print(len(mystring2))


This assigns the variables and then doing the print type will tell you what type of variable each is
x=20
y=389.7
z="Hello, world!"
print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))

This will take the integar 3 and make it a float
x=3
x=float(x)
print(type(x))


Write a python program which prompts a message to
ask the user the specify his own age, his two
neighborsâ€™ ages, and output the average age. 


```python
    print("Specify his own age, his two neighbors ages, and output the average age")
    age= input("How old are you?")
    neighbor1= input("How old is neighbor1")
    neighbor2= input("How old is neighbor2")
    print("Your average age between you two would be ", (int(age)+int(neighbor1)+int(neighbor2))/3)
```
